This Project is based in two applications, the first one is an API developed using Python that calculates predicted values to water flow, the main idea is to predict consumption of water based in historical of consumption and methereological data. The second application is a web app developed with REACT Typescript to show this results and generate an plataform to operators get an analitic vision about the water consumption and decrease the react time when happens some issue like water leaks.
